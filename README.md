# PCA-Based Image Classification with SVM

This project demonstrates a simple image classification pipeline using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The dataset used in this code consists of images grouped by person names.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `PIL` (Pillow)
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pillow scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset should be organized in the following structure:

```
DataSet/
    ├── Abraham lincoln/
    │    ├── image1.jpg
    │    ├── image2.jpg
    │    └── ...
    ├── Anwar Sadat/
    │    ├── image1.jpg
    │    ├── image2.jpg
    │    └── ...
    └── ...
```

- Each subfolder corresponds to a person, and the images inside the subfolder are their photos.
- Supported image formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`.

Ensure that the `dataset_path` in the code points to the location of your `DataSet` folder.

## Code Overview

1. **Loading and Preprocessing**: 
   - The script reads images from the dataset, resizes them to `128x256` pixels, converts them to grayscale, and flattens them into one-dimensional vectors.
   - Labels corresponding to each image (person name) are extracted.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**:
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the image data. The number of components can be adjusted, but the code defaults to 6 components or fewer, depending on the number of available images.

3. **Classification (SVM)**:
   - A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained using the PCA-reduced data and then used for predictions.
   - The accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are printed to evaluate the classifier's performance.

4. **Image Reconstruction**:
   - The script reconstructs an image using the inverse PCA transformation and displays it for visual comparison.

## How to Use

1. Place your dataset in the `DataSet` folder and update the `dataset_path` in the code to point to it.
2. Run the script to:
   - View an original image.
   - Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction.
   - Train an SVM classifier.
   - View the classification report and confusion matrix.
3. Optionally, modify the `index` variable to display different images and see the PCA reconstruction.

### Example Output:

- Display of an original image from the dataset.
- Display of the reconstructed image after PCA transformation.
- Classification results, including accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## Customization

- You can change the image size by modifying the `image_size` variable (currently set to `128x256`).
- Adjust the number of PCA components by modifying the `n_components` variable.
- Modify the index in the code to display different images from the dataset.
